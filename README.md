# Portfolio_Homework

<p>Creating my first Portfolio was a very bumpy road. The road blocks seemed to be endless. At the end I have to admit that I learned a great deal from it.
I referenced hundreds of sites and videos in order to get my website presentable. Afters days of customization my hard work payed off. The hardest part for me was the Portfolio page. Padding, Margins, floats & clear:both was my biggest challenge.
